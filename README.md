# giphySearch
https://github.com/gwyndall/giphySearch.git

This project uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice, and uses JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the page.  The user can add buttons by entering new topics in the text box, and clicking a button adds new gifs to the top of the page.  I chose to make the search specific to Brooklyn Nine-Nine and styled the page accordingly.
